## 🔧 Configuration

### Enable AI Analysis
The tool works standalone, but you can enable Claude API for enhanced analysis:

```javascript
// AI analysis happens automatically if the API is accessible
// No configuration needed - it falls back to local analysis if unavailable
```

### Disable AI Analysis
```javascript
// Comment out the analyzeWithClaude function call
// Tool will use local analysis only
```
